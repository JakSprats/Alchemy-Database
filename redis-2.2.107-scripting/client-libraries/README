An updated list of client libraries for Redis can be found here:

    http://redis.io/clients

All the links are in the front page.

Most mainstream (and less mainstream) languages are supported.

If you plan to write a new client library for a missing language, please
get in touch with the other developers writing a message to the Redis google
group that is located here: http://groups.google.com/group/redis-db

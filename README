Alchemy Database: A Hybrid Relational-Database/NOSQL-Datastore

Project Home Page: http://code.google.com/p/alchemydatabase/

Alchemy Database is a full RDBMS and a full NOSQL datastore in a single server
Alchemy Database is a lightweight OLTP SQL server w/ full support for redis data-structures/commands. Datastore-side-scripting is provided by embedding Lua. Alchemy Database is also blazingly fast and extremely memory efficient.

  Speed is achieved by being an event driven network server that stores ALL data in RAM and achieves disk persistence by using a spare cpu-core to periodically log data changes (i.e. no threads, no locks, no undo-logs, no disk-seeks, serving data over a network at RAM speed)
  Storage data structures w/ very low memory overhead and data compression, via algorithms w/ insignificant performance hits, greatly increase the amount of data you can fit in RAM
  Optimising to the SQL statements most commonly used in OLTP workloads yields a lightweight SQL server designed for low latency at high concurrency (i.e. mindblowing speed).

QUICK HOW TO
BUILD:
1,) git://github.com/JakSprats/Alchemy-Database.git
2.) cd Alchemy-Database
3.) make
RUN:
1.) ./alchemy-server
EXPERIMENT (run from command line, some characters '(',')','*' must be escaped)
./alchemy-cli CREATE TABLE test \(id int primary key, field TEXT, name TEXT\)
OK
./alchemy-cli INSERT INTO test VALUES "(1,field1,name1)"
OK
./alchemy-cli INSERT INTO test VALUES "(2,field2,name2)"
OK
./alchemy-cli SELECT \* FROM test WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 2
1. "1,field1,name1"
2. "2,field2,name2"

Alchemy Database: A Hybrid Relational-Database/NOSQL-Datastore

Project Home Page: http://code.google.com/p/alchemydatabase/

Latest Release Candidate: Feb 28, 2012: release_0.2_rc1: https://github.com/JakSprats/Alchemy-Database/tree/release_0.2_rc1

Alchemy Database is a low-latency high-TPS NewSQL RDBMS embedded in the NOSQL datastore redis. Extensive datastore-side-scripting is provided via deeply embedded Lua. Unstructured data, can also be stored, as there are no limits on #tables, #indexes, #columns, and sparsely populated rows use minimal memory.

QUICK HOW TO
BUILD:
1,) git clone git://github.com/JakSprats/Alchemy-Database.git
2.) cd Alchemy-Database
3.) make
RUN:
1.)  cd redis/src
2.) ./alchemy-server ../redis.conf
EXPERIMENT (run from command line, some characters '(',')','*' must be escaped)
./alchemy-cli CREATE TABLE test "(id int primary key, field TEXT, name TEXT)"
OK
./alchemy-cli INSERT INTO test VALUES "(1,'field1','name1')"
OK
./alchemy-cli INSERT INTO test VALUES "(2,'field2','name2')"
OK
./alchemy-cli SELECT "*" FROM test WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 2
1) "1,'field1','name1'"
2) "2,'field2','name2'"

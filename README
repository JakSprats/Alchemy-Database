Redisql: A Hybrid Relational-Database/NOSQL-Datastore

Redisql is a full RDBMS and a full NOSQL datastore combined into one server
In Redisql, SQL Tables, Statements, and Data-types are supported. Redisql is built on top of the NOSQL datastore redis, supports all redis data-structures and commands and supports (de)normalisation of these data structures (lists,sets,hash-tables) to/from SQL tables. Redisql can also easily import/export tables to/from Mysql. Redisql is more than a data storage Swiss Army Knife, it is also extremely fast and extremely efficient w/ memory.

NOTE The Redisql project's documentation has been moved to http://code.google.com/p/redisql/

The code will still reside in github, but the documentation and issue tracking will be done in google code

QUICK HOW TO
BUILD:
1,) git clone git://github.com/JakSprats/Redisql.git
2.) cd Redisql
3.) make platform # platform can be "aix ansi bsd freebsd generic linux macosx mingw posix solaris"
RUN:
1.) ./redisql-server
EXPERIMENT (run from command line, some characters '(',')','*' must be escaped)
./redisql-cli CREATE TABLE test \(id int primary key, field TEXT, name TEXT\)
OK
./redisql-cli INSERT INTO test VALUES "(1,field1,name1)"
OK
./redisql-cli INSERT INTO test VALUES "(2,field2,name2)"
OK
./redisql-cli SELECT \* FROM test WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 2
1. "1,field1,name1"
2. "2,field2,name2"

Dislaimer: this project is in no way affiliated w/ the "redis" project. The name RediSQL was used to illustrate that this project effectively combines "redis" and "SQL"
This project will be renamed in the near future to avoid any confusion.
The renaming process will take some time to propagate through the various github repositories, website, blog, mailing-list, etc...

Alsosql: A Hybrid Relational-Database/NOSQL-Datastore

Alsosql is a full RDBMS and a full NOSQL datastore combined into one server
In Alsosql, SQL Tables, Statements, and Data-types are supported. Alsosql is built on top of the NOSQL datastore [http://code.google.com/p/redis/ redis], supports all redis data-structures and commands and supports (de)normalisation of these data structures (lists,sets,hash-tables) to/from SQL tables. Alsosql can also easily import/export tables to/from Mysql. Alsosql is more than a data storage Swiss Army Knife, it is also extremely fast and extremely efficient w/ memory.

NOTE The Alsosql project's documentation has been moved to http://code.google.com/p/alsosql/

The code will still reside in github, but the documentation and issue tracking will be done in google code

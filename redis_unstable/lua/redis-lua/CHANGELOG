v2.0.2 (2011-??-??)
  * Added an abstraction for PUB/SUB that makes possible to consume messages 
    pushed to channels using a coroutine-based iterator.

  * Added support for connecting to Redis using UNIX domain sockets when they
    are available in LuaSocket.

v2.0.1 (2011-01-24)
  * Vastly improved abstraction for Redis transactions (MULTI/EXEC) supporting 
    check-and-set (CAS), automatic retries upon transaction failures and a few 
    optional arguments for initialization (enable CAS support, list of keys to 
    watch automatically and number of attempts upon failed transactions). The 
    public interface is completely backwards compatible with previous versions.

  * Pipelines and transactions return the number of commands processed as the 
    second return value, useful for iterating over a returned list of replies 
    that contains holes (nil values).

  * Since SORT can accept multiple GET parameters, redis:sort() has been 
    modified accordingly to accept either a string or a table for the 'get' 
    parameter.

v2.0.0 (2010-11-27)
  * The client library is no longer compatible with Redis 1.0.

  * Support for long names of Redis commands has been dropped, the client now 
    uses the same command names as defined by Redis.

  * Inline and bulk requests are not supported anymore and the related code 
    has been removed from the library. Commands are defined as multibulk 
    requests by default.

  * The public interface for pipelining has been slightly changed (see the 
    examples/pipeline.lua file for more details).

  * The public interface for Redis transactions (MULTI/EXEC) basically works 
    in the same way of pipelining.

  * Developers can now define their own commands at module level and not only 
    on client instances.

v1.0.1 (2010-07-30)
  * Providing a more generalized version of the multibulk request serializer.

  * _G is now passed as the argument of a pipeline block. This will change in 
    a future major release of redis-lua, but for now it is useful to enable 
    the usage of global functions inside of a pipeline block.

  * Fix: user-added commands were not available when pipelining commands.

v1.0.0 (2010-06-02)
  * First versioned release of redis-lua

This is Redis 2.3.x.

It was forked from 2.2 branch a few weeks ago, and is going to be the playground
for many new developments, especially related to replacing the VM with something
better.

VM is already completely removed from this release, and instead diskstore was
implemented. You can read more about it here:

This Redis version is not intented for production environments.

Cheers,
Salvatore

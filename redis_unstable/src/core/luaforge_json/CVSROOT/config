# Set this to "no" if pserver shouldn't check system users/passwords
#SystemAuth=no

# Put CVS lock files in this directory rather than directly in the repository.
#LockDir=/var/lock/cvs

# Set `TopLevelAdmin' to `yes' to create a CVS directory at the top
# level of the new working directory when using the `cvs checkout'
# command.
#TopLevelAdmin=no

# Set `LogHistory' to `all' or `TOEFWUPCGMAR' to log all transactions to the
# history file, or a subset as needed (ie `TMAR' logs all write operations)
#LogHistory=TOEFWUPCGMAR

# Set `RereadLogAfterVerify' to `always' (the default) to allow the verifymsg
# script to change the log message.  Set it to `stat' to force CVS to verify
# that the file has changed before reading it (this can take up to an extra
# second per directory being committed, so it is not recommended for large
# repositories.  Set it to `never' (the previous CVS behavior) to prevent
# verifymsg scripts from changing the log message.
#RereadLogAfterVerify=always

# Set `UserAdminOptions' to the list of `cvs admin' commands (options)
# that users not in the `cvsadmin' group are allowed to run.  This
# defaults to `k', or only allowing the changing of the default
# keyword expansion mode for files for users not in the `cvsadmin' group.
# This value is ignored if the `cvsadmin' group does not exist.
#
# The following string would enable all `cvs admin' commands for all
# users:
#UserAdminOptions=aAbceIklLmnNostuU

# Set `UseNewInfoFmtStrings' to `no' if you must support a legacy system by
# enabling the deprecated old style info file command line format strings.
# Be warned that these strings could be disabled in any new version of CVS.
UseNewInfoFmtStrings=yes
